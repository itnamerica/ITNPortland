    <p class="mt-25">Fine Rides for Fine Arts is a collaboration between ITN<em>Portland</em>, the Portland Symphony Orchestra and Portland Stage Company. It pairs volunteer drivers with older arts patrons who otherwise might have to give up their tickets to their favorite performances. The program improves access to the arts for older patrons, and at the same time creates a fund for older riders of limited means to ensure everyone has access to their favorite shows and performances.</p>
    
    <p class="mt-25">Do you want to help others, keep your community arts organizations vibrant and spend your free timemeeting interesting new people? Become a volunteer driver for ITN<em>Portland</em>, and designate your credits to the Fine Rides for Fine Arts program.</p>
